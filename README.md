# Bloomia
This Google Chrome extension was made as a submission for the Congressional App Challenge.
<p></p>
ü™∑ Bloomia is an AI-powered Google Chrome extension that takes plant images as input and provides feedback in the form of care tips to help you grow and bloom your personal garden.
<p></p>
The Process:
<br>
--> I made this extension as part of the Congressional App Challenge, with a main goal being to (1) improve my skills and explore new topics and (2) create something that could be helpful for others. Here, this extension hopefully allows users to take a step towards environmental wellbeing and explore gardening. To achieve a more environmentally friendly world, we need to take small individual steps, and Bloomia serves as an easy first step users can take.
<br>
--> Over the course of ~11 hours, I coded my project. I utilized many resources to help me get started, but as I continued to add features, I strengthened my understanding of JavaScript, allowing me to integrate more.
<br>
--> This project served as a large milestone for me, as it's one of my first individual projects involving AI and a decent understanding of JavaScript. These served as 2 of my largest struggles, but through tackling them despite my apprehensions, I was able to learn and improve upon myself, building on my prior knowledge and gaining confidence. While there were certainly many difficulties I faced, I think this served as a large growth experience for me.
